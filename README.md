Inkly is a 3D t-shirt customization website built with React and Three.js for rendering interactive 3D models. Primarily developed in JavaScript, with some CSS and HTML, Inkly provides users with a highly interactive experience for designing their own t-shirts.

Upon opening Inkly, users are greeted by a moving 3D t-shirt model that reacts to their mouse movements, along with a welcome message. Clicking on the Customize It button transitions users to a customization page, where they can personalize the t-shirt's color, upload images as logos or full-shirt designs, and even use OpenAI's DALL-E to generate AI images for their designs.

Customization features include buttons to toggle between logo and full-shirt designs and the ability to download an image of the uniquely designed t-shirt. A Back button is available at the top right, allowing users to return to the welcome page, with their t-shirt design intact for further editing.

The backend of Inkly utilizes MongoDB for data storage, Node.js and Express for server-side functionality, and Cloudinary for image storage. The website is styled with Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive and clean user interface. Additionally, Vite is used for efficient local development.

Inkly combines modern 3D rendering technologies with AI to provide users with an intuitive and creative platform for personalizing t-shirts.
